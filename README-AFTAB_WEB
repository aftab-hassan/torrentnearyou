1.The browser does not/doesn't have to convert Js to html. If it did, then view page source would not give you JS, it would
 give you only plain HTML (converted).

 That means, the browser can understand both HTML and JS

2.It's php code which is converted to html and JS by the php interpreter

3.Why web server
  Yes, it's the php interpreter which does all the heavy lifting, and converts php code to what the browser can understand (HTML and JS)
  But when hosted on a remove server, and not on localhost, SOMETHING needs to call the php interpreter and call to duty.
  Also, that SOMETHING needs to send this converted HTML and JS back to the same port/client/IP address from where the reqeust was sent.
  This is probably where the web server comes in.
