1.The main thing about AJAX is that data is coming from PHP, but still the page does not get reloaded.
The usual way to do it is to submit a form, which then goes to a php page, so basically a new page IS loaded.

2.AJAX came first in Feb 2005 when I was in 9th : http://adaptivepath.org/ideas/ajax-new-approach-web-applications/

JQuery is a library which was designed later in Aug 2006, when I was studying for the 10th boards.
At the time JQuery was being developed, probably AJAX was the big new development. So the JQuery developers just wrote an easier wrapper
to call the same ajax functions. Kind of unnecessary. AJAX is the original one

3.AJAX - there is no XML anywhere
AJAX is short for "Asynchronous JavaScript+CSS+DOM+XMLHttpRequest"
So, the X actually stands for XMLHttpRequest, which is how a request is sent to the PHP server
